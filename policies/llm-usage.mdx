<Info>
  We appreciate the significance of artificial intelligence and large language models; however, it is imperative that their utilization is conducted responsibly.
</Info>

We encourage the utilization of AI to enhance your communication, but there are explicit limitations. Kindly adhere to the guidelines outlined below to ensure the acceptance of your work.

## What you can do

You may utilize large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, for the following purposes:

- Ensure the accuracy of your grammar and diction
- Refine the phrasing and tone subtly, provided that the fundamental ideas and structure remain your own

<Warning>
  Please refrain from requesting LLMs to entirely revise your responses, as this frequently yields generic and monotonous content that may be readily identified as artificial.
</Warning>

## What you cannot do

You are **prohibited from** utilizing LLMs for the following purposes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Assessing or evaluating model responses">
    Numerous prompts are crafted to deceive even the most advanced models — we value your reasoning.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Providing justifications or explanations">
    The objective is to assess your own reasoning, rather than an artificial intelligence's interpretation of it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Predicting code behaviour or runtime results">
    Large Language Models (LLMs) are often inaccurate in complex programming scenarios.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Submissions that are evidently produced by artificial intelligence will be identified and flagged accordingly.
</Warning>

## Final reminder

It is generally apparent what is authored by a human as opposed to what is produced by a model. Preserve your authentic voice, be original, and employ AI solely for assistance — not as a replacement.
