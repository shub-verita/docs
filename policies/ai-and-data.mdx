## How your data appears on Verita

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your data is stored securely">
    Following the submission of your resume or participation in an interview, the data undergoes parsing and is subsequently utilized to enhance your profile and improve search visibility.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Companies can find talent through AI search">

    Your Verita profile encompasses experience, skills, education, and employment history. Compensation expectations are **not** publicly visible.

## How Verita generates revenue

Verita applies a margin to companies' pay rates once you accept a role. This compensates us for sourcing, vetting, and placing candidates. In summary, we only generate revenue when you are successfully placed on a project.
