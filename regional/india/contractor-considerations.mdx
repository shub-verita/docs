<Warning>
  None of the below information should be considered legal or tax advice. All contractors are responsible for ensuring they comply with local laws and tax regulations in India.
</Warning>

We recommend consulting a qualified chartered accountant or legal advisor for guidance specific to your situation.

## Work Authorization

As a citizen or legal resident of India, you may work as an **independent contractor** with international clients, including Verita.

You are responsible for:

- Ensuring you are allowed to offer freelance or consulting services
- Complying with the **Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA)** and **RBI regulations** for receiving international payments
- Maintaining proper business registration and tax documentation if required

<Info>
  Verita engages contractors **only as independent individuals**. We do not provide local employment contracts or work visas.
</Info>

## Taxes & Income Reporting

Verita does **not withhold** any Indian income tax or GST from your payments. You are classified as a **self-employed contractor**, and you must report this income to the **Income Tax Department of India**.

### Tax filing responsibilities

You are responsible for:

- Reporting income earned from Verita in your **ITR (Income Tax Return)**
- Paying **income tax** under the appropriate slab or presumptive scheme (e.g., Section 44ADA for professionals)
- Paying **advance tax** if your tax liability exceeds ₹10,000 in a year
- Issuing invoices if required by Indian tax law

## GST (Goods and Services Tax)

<Info>
  If your annual revenue exceeds the GST threshold bracket (₹20 lakh for services in most states), you may need to **register for GST**.
</Info>

Export of services is typically **zero-rated** under GST, but you must file under **LUT (Letter of Undertaking)** to avoid charging GST on export invoices.

You should consult a CA to determine if and when GST applies to your situation.

## Invoicing & Payment

Verita pays via **Stripe**, which will deposit payments into your Indian bank account in INR after currency conversion.

Verita does **not issue invoices to you** — You are welcome to generate your own invoices for recordkeeping or tax compliance.

### Verita's Business Details for Invoicing

- Legal name: Verita Artificial Intelligence
- Address: 2537 Modena Dr, Pittsburg, CA 94565 USA
- EIN (US Tax ID): 39-2250859

## W-8BEN Form (US Tax)

As a non-U.S. contractor, you will be asked to fill out a **W-8BEN form** via Stripe. This form certifies that:

- You are **not a U.S. tax resident**
- You are a **resident of India** and eligible to claim tax treaty benefits

### Claiming the U.S. - India Tax Treaty

India has a tax treaty with the US that allows you to avoid US withholding tax on business income.

In the W-8BEN form:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Country of residence | India |
| Foreign taxpayer identification number (FTIN) | Your **PAN** (Permanent Account Number) |
| Tax Treaty Article | **Article 7** (Business Profits) |

<Tip>
  Stripe handles this process — you don't need to file anything with the IRS directly. Once submitted, **no U.S. tax will be withheld**, and you will **not receive a 1099 form**.
