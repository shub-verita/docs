<Warning>
  None of the below information should constitute legal advice. All contractors are responsible for determining their own immigration status and requirements and ensuring they are eligible to work.
</Warning>

## H-1B Employment Eligibility

<Warning>
  We do **not sponsor** visas or work authorizations of any kind, including H-1B, and are unable to provide documentation for H-1B petitions or transfers.
</Warning>

Contractors are responsible for ensuring that their existing H-1B status allows for independent contractor work, and for verifying any limitations with their immigration attorney or employer sponsor.

<Info>
  In most cases, individuals on H-1B visas are **not authorized to work for any entity other than their sponsoring employer**, even as independent contractors. Please consult a qualified legal professional to ensure compliance.
</Info>

## H-4 Dependent Visas

If you are in the U.S. as a dependent of an H-1B visa holder (H-4 status), you may be eligible to work **only if you have received an Employment Authorization Document (EAD)**.

We can engage with H-4 EAD holders as independent contractors, but:

- We will **not** assist in the EAD application process
- We will only provide an **offer letter** as documentation
- You are responsible for maintaining valid authorization and ensuring your work remains within the scope of your EAD

## General Engagement Limitations

### No Sponsorship or Immigration Support

Verita does not provide visa sponsorships, assist with employment-based petitions, or complete any immigration-related documentation beyond the standard offer letter.

| Documentation | Supported? |
|--------------|------------|
| H-1B petitions or transfers | No |
| Form I-129 | No |
| LCA (Labor Condition Application) filing | No |
