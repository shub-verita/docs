## 1099 vs. W2

Verita provides **freelance, contract opportunities** with amazing companies looking to engage talent for projects.

<Warning>
  Verita does **not** offer W2 positions. Your work with us is not considered "employment" and we will be unable to verify employment as a result.
</Warning>

## 1099-NEC

At the end of each tax year, Verita will provide a **1099-NEC form** to report payments made to you as an independent contractor.

<Info>
  The Form 1099-NEC is specifically used to report payments made to independent contractors, freelancers, or anyone who is not an employee but received payment for services.
