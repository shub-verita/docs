<Warning>
  None of the below information should constitute legal advice. All contractors are responsible for determining their own immigration status and requirements and ensuring they are eligible to work.

## Optional Practical Training (OPT)

### Pre/Post Completion OPT

We will engage with you once this is approved by your university DSO, but will **only be able to share an offer letter**.

<Info>
  We understand that some universities and institutions require more documentation and we are **not able to provide this**.
</Info>

### No Guaranteed Hours or Duration

<Warning>
  Verita's engagements can start and stop or have changes to the amount of hours available quickly. We **cannot guarantee** a minimum number of hours of work per week, or when a project may come to a close.
</Warning>

| OPT Type | Requirements | Verita Recommendation |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Pre-Completion OPT** | Must work **less than 20 hours** per week | You are responsible for ensuring you do not exceed this cap |
| **Post-Completion OPT** | Must work **at least 20 hours** per week | We highly encourage Verita to be a **secondary opportunity**, not your only role |

Because our hours and work availability can be more inconsistent, we do highly encourage Verita to be a secondary opportunity, instead of your one and only role for Post-Completion OPT.

## STEM OPT

<Warning>
  Due to the additional operational overhead, we **do not engage** contractors under STEM OPT status.

  - We will **not** be able to sign a Form I-983
  - If you are already working on STEM OPT with another business, you are **not allowed** to do work outside of that business
</Warning>

In other words, you are not able to work with us if already working with somebody else under STEM OPT.

## Curricular Practical Training (CPT)

Contractors under CPT can be engaged if the work is integral to their curriculum and authorized by their educational institution. We will provide **only an offer letter** in these cases.

## E-Verify

Verita's legal name is **Verita Artificial Intelligence**.

<Info>
  Our E-Verify company ID can be provided upon request for your institution's records.
