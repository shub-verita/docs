<Warning>
  None of the below information should constitute legal, tax, or immigration advice. All contractors are responsible for determining their own tax obligations and right to work in their respective countries.
</Warning>

For personalized advice, we recommend consulting with a local accountant or legal professional in your country of residence.

## Work Authorization

Verita only engages with individuals who have the **right to work and provide freelance services** in their country of residence.

You are responsible for ensuring you:

- Are legally allowed to perform freelance or independent contractor work
- Comply with any registration requirements in your country (e.g., freelancer permits, tax ID, etc.)

<Info>
  Verita does **not sponsor visas** or provide local employment contracts within the EU.

## W-8BEN Form for EU-Based Contractors

If you are a contractor living in the EU and working with Verita, you'll be required to fill out a **W-8BEN form** during onboarding via Stripe.

This form certifies that:

- You are **not a U.S. person** for tax purposes
- You may be eligible to claim **reduced or zero U.S. withholding tax** under an income tax treaty between your country and the U.S.

You do not file the W-8BEN with the IRS directly — it is submitted through Verita and kept on file.

### Key Sections to Fill

<Steps>
  <Step title="Part I: Identification">
    - Your full legal name
    - Country of citizenship
    - Residential or business address (must be outside the U.S.)
    - **Foreign Taxpayer Identification Number (FTIN)**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Part II: Claim of Tax Treaty Benefits">
    - Select your country of tax residence
    - Certify you're eligible under the relevant treaty article (usually **Article 7 - Business Profits**)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Part III: Certification">
    - Electronically sign and submit through Verita
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Will I Receive a U.S. Tax Form?

**No.** As a non-U.S. person, you will **not receive a 1099**. Your income is not reported to the IRS as long as your W-8BEN is valid.

You are still responsible for:

- Reporting your income to your **local tax authority**
- Paying any applicable income tax or social security contributions in your country

## Tax & Income Reporting

Verita does **not withhold taxes** from your payments. You are classified as an **independent contractor** and are responsible for reporting and paying all required taxes in your country:

- Income tax
- Social security contributions
- Local business or trade taxes

You will **not receive a 1099 form** or equivalent from Verita. You should report your income based on the Stripe payout records and your own bookkeeping.

<Tip>
  We highly recommend keeping:
  - Invoices or payment confirmations
  - Local business registration details (if applicable)
  - Annual income summaries (from Stripe or your own accounting)
</Tip>

## Invoicing

Verita does not issue invoices to you. If required by your country's tax authority, you are welcome to generate your own invoices for each payment received.

**Verita's legal details for invoicing:**

- Legal name: Verita Artificial Intelligence
- Address: 2537 Modena Dr, Pittsburg, CA 94565 USA
- EIN (US Tax ID): 39-2250859

## VAT (Value Added Tax)

If you are registered for VAT in your country:

- You are responsible for applying VAT where appropriate based on your country's rules
- Verita is **not VAT-registered in the EU** and does not collect or remit VAT on your behalf
- Consult with a local accountant to determine if VAT applies to your services, especially in cross-border B2B arrangements

## Business vs. Individual Work

While many EU countries allow individuals to work as freelancers without a formal company, others may require registration as a **sole proprietor**, **micro-enterprise**, or **freelance business**.

<Warning>
  Verita does **not currently support B2B payments** to registered businesses. All contractors must accept payment as individuals via Stripe.
</Warning>

You are free to:

- Track expenses and income as a registered freelancer
- Deduct allowable business costs
- File taxes accordingly in your jurisdiction
